# Two ways of animating your Banner Images

- index.html is linked to app.js and main.css
- make a div for your banner and a grid for your thumbnail images
- for my example I resized the images to about 75 KB with a batch processing program
- the setTimeout is only to rmove the select animation from thumbnail

## automated Image slider

- next.html is linked to style.css and main.js
- you can map or use a forEach loop 
- make an array out of your images to make the function works [:-)]
- you can improve with the CSS to animate the imageSlider the way you like it
